    <h2>PLOT</h2>
  <p>Andrew Niemann, only nineteen years old, wants to   equal  like Buddy Rich as the best jazz drummer in the world. This objective is kept alive despite Jim's father, a
    high school teacher, not having a great musical background and having failed as a writer. The top music institution in the country, Shaffer Conservatory of Music, is
    welcoming Andrew for his first year of study. Being the greatest at Shaffer allows him to study with Terence Fletcher and is invited to participate in his studio band,
    which performs at jazz festivals on behalf of the school. Andrew is shocked when Fletcher invites him to join the band, although he is initially more than eager to play
    the role of backup drummer after their less than ideal first meeting. Andrew  performing well but also knowing when you're not performing well and what you're doing
    wrong. His method of operation create fear in the group, making every man and woman fearful of him or her. In any case, Andrew strives to be the greatest. He needs to assess what
    matters most  to him in life and what he willing to give up in order to succeed. Another issue is how much emotional torture he will take from Fletcher in order to achieve that success, which
    he might think he can only get through the doors that.

    <h2>REVIEWS</h2>
  <p>Whiplash is low budget film making at its finest, and surely promises big things from rookie director/writer
    Damien Chazelle. Seeing this film in theaters was the first time this year that I have completely enraptured
    (granted, I have not seen all of the top films that have come out so far). Also, I am a succor for quality films about
    musicians, and Whiplash ranks in my all time favorites in that genre. The tension did not let up from the very first
    scene, especially as soon as the incredible J.K. Simmons enters. Simmons, along with Miles Teller (who's Project
    X days are now long behind him) have some of the best on screen chemistry I've seen. They're connected; one
    cannot act without it affecting the other. The film is almost entirely focused on this relationship, and the
    simplicity definitely services the film. I hope people will go and see it and vote with their pocketbooks for excellent low budget films.
